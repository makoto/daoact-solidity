# Audit checklist

- Is the library version up to date?

## Test Todo

- `ledger`
- `investedAmountOf`
- What happens owner_address is not the actual contact deployed address?

## Notes

- Is `function() payable` needed?
- What is `isCrowdsale` for?
- No minimum nor max amount raised. What happens if max amount exceeds ICO limit?
- Why do we need `buy` and `invest`? Why not just `buy`?

## Suggestions

- Add max cap
- Remove unnecessary codes
